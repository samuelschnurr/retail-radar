# RetailRadar

This repository provides full access to the "RetailRadar" application - a full-stack single-page application (SPA) where users can interact with the AI chatbot "Chappie." Chappie is an OpenAI-powered assistant that asks users about their preferences and product wishes, then recommends suitable products available on Amazon.

Although the application is no longer officially maintained, it can still be set up and hosted independently using the code provided in this repository.
